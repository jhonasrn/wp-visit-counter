A lightweight plugin to track daily visits to your WordPress site, with an admin dashboard and date filters.

== Description ==

WP Visit Counter is a simple and efficient plugin that tracks how many visitors access your site each day. It stores visit data in a JSON file and displays it in a clean admin dashboard.

Features include:

* Daily visit tracking
* Display today's visitor count
* Admin dashboard with date range filters
* Shortcode to display total visits: `[visit_counter]`
* No database required â€” uses a JSON file for storage

Perfect for small sites that want basic analytics without relying on external services.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
3. Use the shortcode `[visit_counter]` in any post or page
4. Go to **Visit Counter** in the admin menu to view daily stats
